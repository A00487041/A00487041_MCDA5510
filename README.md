My name is Mohammed Abdul Thoufiq, and my preferred name is Thoufiq. I am from India, where I completed my undergraduate degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering. I then joined Deloitte as a Data Analyst and worked there for 1.8 years. My A-number is A00487041, and my preferred email is mohammed.abdul.thoufiq.-@smu.ca.
I am interested in technologies such as Data Science, Data Engineering, and Data Analysis. I also have an interest in learning Full Stack Web Development.
A fun fact about me is that I love collecting sneakers. I once won a pair of sneakers worth $900 for just $120 in a Nike raffle.
